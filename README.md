# SseClock
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Server-Sent Events (SSE) using C#. The application sends the current server time to the browser every second, updating the UI in real-time without the need for client-side polling. The project includes an SSE endpoint (/time) and a basic HTML page to display the time updates.
